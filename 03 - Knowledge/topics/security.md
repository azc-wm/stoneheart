## Claim

> Security is the discipline of reducing the likelihood and impact of unauthorized actions against a system to an acceptable level of risk.

---
## Explanation

Security is not the absence of vulnerabilities, but the **management of risk** in the presence of adversaries, failures, and uncertainty.

Core elements of security:
- **Assets**: what must be protected (data, systems, availability)
- **Threats**: what could cause harm (attackers, misuse, accidents)
- **Controls**: safeguards that reduce risk (technical, procedural)
- **Risk**: likelihood × impact of an adverse event

Security applies across multiple dimensions:
- **Confidentiality**: preventing unauthorized disclosure
- **Integrity**: preventing unauthorized modification
- **Availability**: ensuring systems remain usable (CIA triad)

Security is a system property that emerges from:
- Architecture and design decisions
- Correct implementation
- Operational discipline (patching, monitoring, incident response)

## Implications

- Absolute security is impossible; tradeoffs must be explicit.
- Security controls impose cost, friction, and complexity.
- Weak identity or authorization undermines all higher-level controls.
- Security failures are often systemic, not isolated bugs.
